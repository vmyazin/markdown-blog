You are here, checking out Tapirio. Welcome! You are probably a developer or a designer, or someone who is looking for a way to implement their project. You most likely know what it is that you want to build, but in case you are still looking for some ideas, I’ve got you covered.

When people are looking for a solution for their web project, they often want to know, “Can I build [blank] with X?”. I’ll show you four types of projects you can build with Tapirio.

## Why Choose Tapirio For Your Next Project

Tapirio is not a solution for every kind of project. When taken “out of the box,” it doesn’t have a lot of bells and whistles, and that’s by design. The good news is that it’s a great foundation to build upon. You need to be open to using the fantastic templating language (and an HTML-replacement) called [Pug](https://pugjs.org/language/attributes.html) and [Sass (SCSS)](https://sass-lang.com). These neat technologies are relatively easy to pick up and will make you unstoppable in implementing any layout type. Tapirio also comes preloaded with styles from Bootstrap.

## What You Can Build With Tapirio

### Professional Services Website

If your goal is to have several static pages, you don’t need much more than a simple website engine with a router pointing to various pages. This setup can be suitable for a copywriter, a lawyer, a barber, a tutor.

### Personal Blog

The main offering of the Tapirio platform is the straight-forward blogging setup. Add new posts as Markdown files, keep the syntax clean and legible. The file names become the last part of your post URLs (sometimes called “slug”). It’s elegant and fast. Example: [vasilym.com](https://www.vasilym.com)

### Podcasting Website

Podcasts are mostly accessed through audio players on smartphones, but they also need a website that mirrors the show notes and shows contact information. If you already know how to manage your XML feed, you can host it on Tapirio. Example: [techlifepodcast.com](https://www.techlifepodcast.com)

### Landing Pages For An Online Business
